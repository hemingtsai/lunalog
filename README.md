# Lunalog

## Brief

This is a part of *Project Luna*.

It's a modern blog system based Python and FastAPI.

***Warning***: It's only a backend. I like to call it "Blog System Core". You should compose a frontend website to use it.

## Technology Stack

|Item|Software|
|-----------|---------------|
|Programming Language|Python|
|Backend Framework|FastAPI|

We don't use any database system, we use filesystem and json to save blog data.
